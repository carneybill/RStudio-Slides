*The primary mission of RStudio is to build a sustainable open-source business that creates software for data science and statistical computing.* 

*Our open source projects are supported by our commercial products that help teams of R users work together effectively, share computing resources, and publish their results to decision makers within the organization.*

# What we do

.large[
- Build and promote software that supports reproducible data analysis
  - Primary focus is usability in our interfaces and APIs
  - Open-source products have become the de facto standards for R statistical programming
- Our tools are not for everyone, but they are  available to everyone (Like R itself)
  - 70% of our engineering effort is towards open source: RStudio, Shiny, R Markdown, dplyr, etc.
  - The essential parts of our stack must be open source
- Achieve a  sustainable business model, primarily from commercially-licensed versions of our servers
  - Helpful features in our Pro products for: Security, Scalability, Manageability, Auditing, Deployment, Collaboration, etc
  - <highlight>If you've licensed our Pro products, thank you for supporting us!</highlight>
