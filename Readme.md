- Continued with Edgar's tamplate he used for rstudio::conf (including this Read Me)
- Includes a custom CSS file (rstudio.css) that defaults to the official colors and fonts. Edgar put together the first version of this CSS file a few months ago from Robby's repo: https://github.com/rstudio/rs-styles
- Included examples from different presentations

Install - xaringan 6.0, kableExtra, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr, rmarkdown
